# Introduction

Sliver is a Command and Control (C2) system made for penetration testers, red teams, and blue teams. It generates implants that can run on virtually every architecture out there, and securely manage these connections through a central server. 

Sliver is developped by Ronan Kervella and Joe Demesy.
